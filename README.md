## Technologies Used

This app is created with the following technologies:
- React version: 17.0.1 --- Bootstrapped with [Create React App](#learn-more-about-create-react-app)
- React-router-dom version: 5.2.0
- Bootstrap version: 4.5.3 and React-bootstrap version: 1.4.0 for core layout
- Node-SASS version: 4.14.1 for custom SCSS


## Getting Started

### If you'd like to run this project locally

1. Clone the repository

From the project root directory in the terminal, input the following commands:

1. `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
2. `npm start` to start the client in development mode.
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

[**For more about Create React App and the functionality it provides see the bottom of this document**](#learn-more-about-create-react-app)

## Planned Improvements
* Add tests
* Add error handling
* Add ability to add and view book covers
* Add a list view
* Add ability to start a second "card"

## Other Available Scripts

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
